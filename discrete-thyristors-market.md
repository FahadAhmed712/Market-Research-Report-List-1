<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Discrete Thyristors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unidirectional Thyristor</li><li>Bidirectional Thyristor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The discrete thyristors market comprises two main types: unidirectional thyristors and bidirectional thyristors. Unidirectional thyristors, also known as silicon controlled rectifiers (SCRs), allow current to flow in one direction, making them ideal for applications like motor control and power regulation. Bidirectional thyristors, such as TRIACs, can conduct current in both directions, which is advantageous for alternating current (AC) applications. The choice between these types depends on the specific requirements of the application, including voltage, current capacity, and directionality.</p></p>
